# Multi-paradigm Programming in Scala

This module is designed to help you learn to:

* Solve problems using different paradigms in Scala.

To do this, you will work through a series of exercises with regular support
from a coach.

## Exercises

1. [Fizzbuzz](./01_fizzbuzz.md)
2. [Receipt Printer](./02_receipt_printer.md)
3. [Mixed Feedback Exercise](./03_mixed_feedback/README.md)
4. [Gilded Rose or Bowling (Extension)](./04_gilded_rose.md)

## Resources

* This [Scala Cheatsheet](https://docs.scala-lang.org/cheatsheets/index.html) includes snippets showing how to use all the main constructs of the language. It's ideal as a quick syntax check.
* [sbt - Simple Build Tool quick guide](https://www.scala-sbt.org/1.x/docs/sbt-by-example.html)). `sbt` is the tool that will help you compile and run your code, run your tests, add dependencies, etc.
